# Storyboarding

<!-- TODO: Needs to fit in with storyboard scripting somehow -->

<!-- Two important links are wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Design (visual) and wiki/Storyboard_Scripting (manual coding done by KJ) -->

## Creating a storyboard

The [Storyboard Editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Design) is located in the Design Tab (keyboard shortcut `F2`) of the Beatmap Editor. To create a widescreen storyboard, go to the song setup dialog and check the `Widescreen Support` box in the `Design` tab.

While the built-in editor offers an easy way to control the movement of sprites, it is often regarded as too hard for anything beyond the basics of storyboarding. As a result, storyboard creators, or [storyboarders](/wiki/Storyboarding/Storyboarder), often use [scripts and third-party programs](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting) that generate code for osu! storyboards and provide high-level abstractions, such as particle systems.
