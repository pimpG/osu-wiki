# Kiai time

*For regulations surrounding kiai time, see: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

**Kiai Time** (or *kiai*) is a term given for a "special" timing section to help emphasize a part of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap). Players can tell if a part of a beatmap has a kiai timing section if they see added visual effects in the background (e.g., flashing beats, flying stars, and fountains).

While kiai is active, all [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) will flash at the rhythm of the [main beat](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timing) and stars will explode from the cursor when a [hit circle](/wiki/Hit_object/Hit_circle) is hit. Otherwise, they will fall from the cursor when a [slider](/wiki/Hit_object/Slider) or [spinner](/wiki/Hit_object/Spinner) is followed.

## Beatmapping

Kiai time is most commonly used for the "strongest part of a song" which is usually the chorus. Since kiai sections are the strongest part of a song, they are typically slightly more challenging than the rest of the [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) to follow the song.
