## Ruleset

### Tournament rules

1. The osu!mania 4K World Cup is a country-based team tournament, played on the osu!mania game mode.
   - *Notice: While this competition has been planned as a 3 versus 3 setup, this might change depending on the amount of registrations.*
2. Beatmap scoring will be based on Score V2.
3. The beatmaps for each round will be announced by the Mappool Selector Team on the Sunday before the actual matches take place.
   - Each mappool, with the exception of the Qualifier stage, will contain a *tiebreaker* beatmap. It will only be played in case of a tie in the scoreline in the *best of* system, e.g. 4-4 in a best of 9.
4. Match schedule will be handled by the Tournament Management.
5. If no referees are available at match time, the match will be postponed.
6. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
   - Reviving and surviving during a beatmap is considered as passing it.
7. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
   - Custom skin elements must not be used to alter core gameplay mechanics.
8. If a game ends in a draw it will be nullified and the beatmap replayed, herein called a *rematch*.
9. Teams may ask for a rematch if a team member encounters technical difficulties while playing.
   - "Lag spikes" are not considered a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
   - If a rematch happens, the original roster for each team during that particular beatmap must remain the same. If that is not possible, e.g. by virtue of a technical issue, *both* teams will be allowed to swap rosters.
   - This rule is not to be abused. Referees may veto a rematch request if they find that this is the case.
10. Beatmaps must not be reused in the same match, with the exception of rematches.
11. **The maximum size for a team is 6 players, and the minimum is 3.**
    - This might change depending on the amount of registrations.
12. If less than the minimum amount of required players are present at match time, it can be postponed for up to 10 minutes. If, after this period, there are still not enough players for either, a *win by default* will be declared for the team with the most members present.
    - The minimum amount of required players is defined as the amount of players needed to play a beatmap.
13. Exchanging players during games is allowed without limitations.
14. Players are expected to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Excessive match delays from the players' side may result in penalities being applied.
15. If a player disconnects between beatmaps and the team cannot provide a substitute, the match can be delayed for up to 10 minutes (limited to once per team, per match).
16. All players and staff must be treated with respect. Instructions of the referees and the Tournament Management are to be followed. Decisions labeled as final are not to be objected.
17. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting and provoking other players or staff, delaying the match or other deliberate inappropriate misbehaviour are strictly prohibited.
18. The multiplayer chatrooms underlie the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules). All chat rules apply to the multiplayer chatrooms, too.
    - Breaking the chat rules results in a silence. Silenced players cannot participate at multiplayer matches and must be exchanged for the time being.
19. Unexpected incidences will be handled by the Tournament Management. Referees may allow higher tolerance depending on the given circumstances. This is up to their discretion.
20. Penalties for violating the tournament rules include, but are not limited to:
    - Exclusion of specific players for one beatmap.
    - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match.
    - Declaring the match as forfeited, or as a win by default for the other team.
    - Disqualification from the entire tournament.
    - Disqualification from the current and future official tournaments, until appealed.
21. The Tournament Management reserves the right to modify these rules at any moment. Any such changes will be announced in advance.

### Tournament registration

1. Every user interested in joining their country's team signs up individually.
   - Tournament Management will create a list of potential candidates for a country's team.
   - Tournament Management will declare one candidate captain of their country's team.

   - Captains are expected to choose team members with honesty and good will, with the aim of fielding the strongest team possible.
   - Captains are allowed to exclude themselves from the team list.
   - Captains are allowed to conduct and coordinate "tryouts", tests to gauge player aptitude, on their own terms.
   - Captains may choose, with the approval of the Tournament Management, to delegate their role to other prospective team members.

   - Every registered user will be assigned to their respective country's candidate list.
   - To be successfully accepted on the list, players are required to be placed #5000 and up on the global osu!mania 4K performance ranking, and have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) within the last 12 months.

3. Beatmap selection will alternate between each captain selecting a beatmap out of the mappool.
4. Each captain must use `!roll` once in `#multiplayer`.
   - The winner of the `!roll` starts picking the first beatmap of the match.
   - The loser of the `!roll` starts banning one beatmap, followed by the winner of the `!roll` to ban a beatmap.
5. Teams will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready.
   - In case a team takes more than 2 minutes to pick a map, they will recieve a warning from the referee, on subsequent occurrences the referee will pick a random map available to pick from the mappool using `!roll X`, where X is the number of available maps to pick in the mappool.
   - Each team will receive a "tactical timeout" of **two minutes**, which can be used at any time during their team's pick, **once per match**. *The tactical timeout is optional, and is not required to be used*.
