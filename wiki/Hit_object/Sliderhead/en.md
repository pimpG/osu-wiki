# Sliderhead

*Sliderheads* or **sliderstarts** are the starting points of all [sliders](/wiki/Hit_object/Slider) found in [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). Once a sliderhead has been clicked the player has to follow along the [sliderbody](/wiki/Hit_object/Sliderbody) with their input device, until the [slidertail](/wiki/Hit_object/Slidertail) is reached and they can release their button. The colour of sliderheads is determined by the combo colours used by the mappers of a beatmap.
