# Hyperfruit

The **hyperfruit** is an effect that can be generated on a [fruit](/wiki/Hit_object/Fruit) or [drop](/wiki/Hit_object/Juice_stream#drop) when the next fruit or drop can't be caught with normal dashing. The movement that is created after catching the hyperfruit is called a [hyperdash](/wiki/Glossary/Hyperdash). This effect will also generate when the last [banana](/wiki/Hit_object/Banana) of a [spinner](/wiki/Hit_object/Spinner) can't be caught with a dash.

During play, this effect is characterized by a coloured outline on the hyperfruit.
