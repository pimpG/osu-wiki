# How to start a beatmap project

*[Please specify project type (Discography, Album, Collab) by LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/12193)*

Note: This article is about the [Beatmap Projects](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/53) forum section and how to approach it.

## Making an informative thread title

*Yes, your thread's title will determine if other osu! users will "yay" or "nay" your Beatmap Project, even before they click on it!*

This should consist `[Discography]` / `[Album]` / `[Collab]` before the title. Chances are high that your project will be ignored or moved to [AW](/wiki/Abandoned_wasteland) if the thread's title lacks on informations.

**Examples:**

How to do:

- `[Album] Pandora Voxx -complete-`
- `[Discography] Deemo`

How **not** to do:

- `starting a new project, need your help with this album`

### Which one do I use?

**Discography:** List of albums/songs released by the singer/group/composer/game overall.

- Examples: [Duca](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/98205), [Linkin Park](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/121592), [Cytus](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/177446)

**Album:** List of songs in the album.

- Examples: [Anamanaguchi - Scott Pilgrim vs The World (The Game)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/37908), [Daft Punk - Random Access Memories](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/132592)

**Collab:** Creating a group-mapping project for a certain song. May range from SB request to mapping parts of a marathon map. [Reference](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/35841)

- Examples: [Voca Nico Party Nonstop Mix - Marathon](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/188118)
