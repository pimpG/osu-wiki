# Beat Snap Divisor

![](img/beat_snap_divisor.png "Beat Snap Divisor in the editor")

The **Beat Snap Divisor** is an editor setting that determines the editor's behaviour in quantising [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) based on the [Beat Snap](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Beat_Snap) principles. It can be found in the upper-right portion of the editor screen, where it corresponds to the granularity of the objects on the [timeline](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timelines); that is, a denser Beat Snap Divisor setting allows for more notes to be placed in the same measure of time and vice versa. 

The beatmap editor supports eleven different Beat Snap Divisor settings as follows:

## 1/1 snap divisor

![](/wiki/shared/1_1_m.jpg "1/1 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/1 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on every *full beat*. It is represented by white-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

Due to its simplicity and ease of use, this snap divisor is most commonly used for Easy difficulties.

## 1/2 snap divisor

![](/wiki/shared/1_2_m.jpg "1/2 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/2 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on *half beats* and their multiples (e.g. 1/2). It is represented by red-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

## 1/3 snap divisor

![](/wiki/shared/1_3_m.jpg "1/3 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/3 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on *triplets*, which is the third fraction of a beat, and their multiples (e.g. 1/3 and 2/3). It is represented by purple-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

Although relatively rare, there are some songs and music genres (e.g. swing jazz) that primarily utilise this snap divisor throughout.

## 1/4 snap divisor

![](/wiki/shared/1_4_m.jpg "1/4 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/4 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on *quarter beats*, which is the fourth fraction of a beat, and their multiples (e.g. 1/4 and 3/4). It is represented by blue-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

Due to its versatility, this snap divisor is extremely popular among mappers and is frequently used in all sorts of beatmaps. It is also the default setting that is designated by the editor upon importing a new audio file.

## 1/5 snap divisor

![](img/1_5_snap_divisor_m.png "1/5 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/5 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on the fifth fraction of a beat and its multiples (e.g. 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5). It is represented by yellow-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

This snap divisor is extremely uncommon and should be used with care. If you find yourself resorting to the 1/5 snap divisor out of the blue, it is recommended that you seek further advice from experienced mappers.

## 1/6 snap divisor

![](/wiki/shared/1_6_m.jpg "1/6 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/6 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on *double triplets*, which is the sixth fraction of a beat, and their multiples (e.g. 1/6 and 5/6). It is represented by purple-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

Although relatively rare, there are some songs and music genres (e.g. swing jazz) that primarily utilise this snap divisor throughout.

## 1/7 snap divisor

![](img/1_7_snap_divisor_m.png "1/7 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/7 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on the seventh fraction of a beat and its multiples (e.g. 1/7, 2/7, 3/7, and so on). It is represented by yellow-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

This snap divisor is extremely uncommon and should be used with care. If you find yourself resorting to the 1/7 snap divisor out of the blue, it is recommended that you seek further advice from experienced mappers.

![](/wiki/shared/1_8_m.jpg "1/8 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/8 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on the eighth fraction of a beat and its multiples (e.g. 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, and 7/8). It is represented by yellow-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

## 1/9 snap divisor

![](img/1_9_snap_divisor.png "1/9 snap divisor in the osu!/osu!taiko/osu!catch editor")

![](img/1_9_snap_divisor_m.png "1/9 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/9 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on the ninth fraction of a beat and its multiples (e.g. 1/9, 2/9, 3/9, and so on). It is represented by yellow-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

This snap divisor is extremely uncommon and should be used with care. If you find yourself resorting to the 1/9 snap divisor out of the blue, it is recommended that you seek further advice from experienced mappers.

## 1/12 snap divisor

![](/wiki/shared/1_12_m.jpg "1/12 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/12 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on the twelfth fraction of a beat and its multiples (e.g. 1/12, 5/12, 7/12, and so on). It is represented by grey-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

This snap divisor is extremely uncommon and should be used with care. If you find yourself resorting to the 1/12 snap divisor out of the blue, it is recommended that you seek further advice from experienced mappers.
