**Compose** is the place where a [mapper](/wiki/Beatmapping) spent most of the time mapping out his/her design with respect to timeline after setting the BPM and Timing Sections. This is also the place where players can practice a ranked difficulty and inspect its design akin to DDR's Training mode.

Due to different needs in mapping style (osu! is very flexible, allowing much room for creativity while osu!mania is restrained to selected key, demanding extreme precision to evoke the keysounds harmonically), osu!'s editor and osu!mania-only's editor are given their own features section. You can easily access osu!mania editor by setting your difficulty to osu!mania-only.

## Features (osu!)

For a newbie guide: [Beatmapping](/wiki/Beatmapping).

(Starting from top-down left-right order)

### Top-Left (Hit Objects Timeline)

<!-- TODO find the article that links to this and possibly redirect to here instead (why is this shared?) -->

![Hit Objects Timeline](/wiki/shared/BE_NTL.jpg "Hit Objects Timeline")

**Your construction toolkit, made for DIY (do it yourself).**

**Please note that in osu!, default note hitsounds work differently than in osu!mania.**

- Adding clap on a notes will play `hitclap` + `hitnormal` sound on hit while in osu!mania: will only play `hitclap` sound on hit

#### Selector

| Buttons / Header (Keyboard Shortcut) | Usage | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Sampleset | Auto, Normal, Soft, Drum | This ignore the timing section's Sampleset setting , and add the selected one... e.g. Timing point with **soft 77%**, While this Sampleset set into **Drum** and have **Clap** on the notes, will play default drum-hitnormal 77% + drum-hitclap 77% on hit |
| Additions | Auto, Normal, Soft, Drum | Additions hitsound means add Clap, Finish, and Whistle with the SELECTED set... e.g. Sampleset **Normal**, Timing point **Soft 77%**, while Additions is set to **Drum** and have **Clap** on the notes, will result of normal-hitnormal 77% + drum-hitclap 77% on hit |
| Select (`1`) | **Left-click/drag:** Select/Adjust the notes/sliderpoints location. **Right-click:** Remove notes/sliderpoints. **`Ctrl` + Click:** Multiple selection. | Select and modify existing notes. |

### Centre (Playfield)

**Visual representation of mapping based on current timestamp.** Map your design here and your design will appear exactly like you mapped during play. This is WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) mapping. For text-based (usually for fine-tuning) mapping, you can open the `.osu` file directly using Notepad.

## Features (osu!mania)

(The top-left hit objects timeline holds no significance. Please ignore it.) For a simple guide: [Basics](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/118868) [Mapping & Keysound](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/139139)

### Top-Right (Beat Snap Divisor)

![Beat Snap Divisor (osu!mania ver.)](img/BEM_BSD.jpg "Beat Snap Divisor (osu!mania ver.)")

*Main article: [Beat Snap Divisor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Beat_Snap_Divisor)*

**In layman's term, adjusting given length of a coloured sewing thread (timing section) for an embroidery design space (measures, divided by the divisor to be called beats) on the cloth (song).** Since osu!mania highly prioritise every timing of the notes, **Time signature** (MM:B) from the Timing section is added (15:3 = 15th measure 3rd beat) beside the adjustment bar for easier mapper's reference. It can go to negative value (-8:-3 for example) if the first timing section is a *few seconds away* from the start of the beatmap's song file.

**Insert Break Time** button will put/stop "Break Time" in current timestamp. Beside the button is the **short sound file name storyboarded to the selected(blue) note**, known as **keysound** (refer to "Sampling" section at the end of this page).

### Centre-Left (Selector)

**Your construction toolkit osu!mania ver., made for DIY.**

**Please note that in osu!mania's default notes hitsound works different with Standard/osu!**

- Adding clap on a notes will only play `hitclap` sound instead of `hitclap` + `hitnormal` sound on hit while in osu!mania :

| Additions | Auto, Normal, Soft, Drum | Basically the same as above, BUT Additions setting overwrite Sampleset setting. Ex : Timing **Drum 55%**, Sampleset **Soft**, while this Additions is **Normal**, will play all related **Normal** sound on the notes like clap , normal , finish, whistle with 55% volume. |
| Select (`1`) | **Left-cilck/drag:** Move timestamp and location of a note. **Right-Click:** Remove note. **`Ctrl` + Click:** Multiple selection. | Select and modify existing notes. |

### Sampling

![Sample pop-up window (Windows 8's ver.)](img/Sample_omc.jpg "Sample pop-up window (Windows 8's ver.)")

**Sampling** is a process of **adding sound to the note.** To begin, select the note and **`Alt` + Left Click** on the selected note (a pop-up window will be shown with sound samples inside your beatmap folder).

#### Sample import

**Left-section** is the **list of sound files you have in the beatmap's folder.**

**Right-section** is **settings for the selected sound file.**

##### Basics

| Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| CustomSet | **Ignoring** selected custom hitsound in this editor, and apply the **default** hitsound **SET** and volume without using timing point. ( Use basic sample must be enable in order to use this to be able to work as its intended )ex : added soft-hitwhistle77.wav with 90% volume.Note that you must add the whistle to the note manually as well. **Also this feature is not recommended while the normal APPLY function in this editor is easier to be used than this one while both of this basically works the same.** |
| Volume | How loud you want this sound file be. Use integer value only. ( 8 - 100 ) |
| Use basic sample | **Ignoring** selected custom hitsound in this editor , and apply only the volume on selected notes.This means , no matter what the notes is about, this feature only changes the selected notes volume.Ex : this can be used to change multiple volume on different notes with different hitsound sample at once or just enhance the default hitsound ignoring any timing point's volume setting. |

##### Buttons

| Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Play | Play the selected sound file |
| Import | Import the custom sound file from a subfolder inside the beatmap's folder |
| Delete | **Delete the custom sound file.** To remove the sound file associated with the note, use the "Reset" button. |
| Apply | Apply this selected custom sound file to this note. |
| Sample | Put this selected custom sound file to the storyboard with respect to current timestamp. |
| Sample list | Storyboarded sound files. Refer "Sample event list" below |
| Reset | Remove the sound file associated with the note |
| Cancel | Close the window. |

#### Sample event list

**Actual storyboarding**. Click on "Sample list" will summon another window (shown in right-side of the picture) named "Sample event list", which would be this. The two buttons should be self-explanatory (Delete = Delete the selected event. Close = Close the window). **These storyboarded elements will go to the `.osu` file (the selected difficulty).**

The coding is `MM:SS:XXX` `{Sound_file}@{Volume}` where MM:SS:XXX is Minutes:Seconds:Milliseconds respectively.

**Example:** 1:57:745 kick.wav@100% means at 1 min 57 second 745th millisecond, trigger the "kick.wav" file at 100% volume regardless of condition.
