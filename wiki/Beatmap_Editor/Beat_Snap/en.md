# Beat Snap

![](img/beat_snap.png "The symbol for Beat Snap as portrayed in an early osu! editor build (circa 2007)")

The **Beat Snap** is a built-in editor functionality that ensures all [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) are snapped/quantised proportionally to the song's beat. It functions based on the common principles of [musical quantisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(music)).
