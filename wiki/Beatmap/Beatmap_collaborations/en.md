# Beatmap collaborations

*For help starting a collaboration, see: [How to start a beatmap collaboration](/wiki/Guides/Collab_Information)*

**Beatmap collaborations**, or ***collabs***, are beatmap works created by multiple people. The word *Collab* may refer to either a single [difficulty](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty), or a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) with [guest difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Guest_difficulty).

Collab difficulties are usually marked by "Collab" or possession of multiple usernames in the difficulty name.
