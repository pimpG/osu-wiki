# Beatmap description

**Beatmap descriptions** are small areas under a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap)'s page that give players information about said beatmap using [BBCode](/wiki/BBCode). Most [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked) beatmaps use at least one image, a number (depending on how many beatmaps the creator has created), and a difficulty section.

## Uses and information

*Notice: In order to get a beatmap ranked, it is recommended that creators have a good beatmap description, but this is not required.*

Popular beatmap descriptions often include the following:

- A list of all the guest difficulties and their creators
- Information that would help a player decide whether they want to download the beatmap or not
- An edits list or changelog

### Images

Many beatmap descriptions contain at least one image (often an animated [GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF "Wikipedia") of some sort), that are used to express and illustrate either the creator, song, and/or beatmap in a flashy way. They can also take places of a title or header to add flair and quality. To learn how to add an image using BBCode, check out the [BBCode article's tutorial on images](/wiki/BBCode#image).

### Difficulty sections

A "difficulty section" is a list of all the guest difficulties and their creators located in a beatmap description. This is mostly used to showcase the difficulties of a beatmap. Difficulty sections usually have images for the icons.

The difficulty icons can be found in the [Difficulty article](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty).
